# AudioCodecs collection

A collection of various audio codecs and their dependencies.

This is a set of dependencies required for SDL Mixer X audio library, except of SDL2 which is updating offten.

This set of libraries is designed to be buildable through QMake building system.

Note: to build libid3tag and libtimidity, you need have latest libSDL2 be installed! (those libraries are modified to support files through SDL_RWops() API)
